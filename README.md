#### Ian's Responsibilities Paragraph
- As outlined above, I am going to design the GUI. I know that the basic GUI will not take that long to design, so I will be able to help others out with the beginning process when needed. I am also going to design unit tests as I go to make the ending process much easier. I know that this is a very challenging process and I know that there might be struggle along the way. I need to be able to work with our members and understand when things are getting hard. Instead of gettting mad, I need to help them through the struggle

#### Connor's Responsibilities Paragraph
- I will help take the lead in creating and distributing tasks for our team as well as being the main communicator with our client throughout the entire process. I also will take a part of trying to test everything and be the main person to try and make sure everything works after something gets pushed to the repo. I will also make sure to do my unit testing for the pieces of code that I create. As a part of this team, I will be thoughtful and helpful for everyone. I understand that this is a long time commitment with this group and we need to have good communication. I will make sure to be flexible and helpful whenever I need to be and try to be the best group partner I can be.

#### Taylor's Responsibilities Paragraph
- As outlined above, I will be helping Connor to meet with the client as well as managing the integrations with API's and widgets while creating unit tests for anything I develop. I will also be flexible in my roles and float to different sections of the project where I can meaningfully add to it. I will keep an open channel of communication and be reach out for help when needed on sections that I find challenging.

#### Josh's Responsibilities Paragraph
- It's important that everyone in the group has the same idea of how the app should look and function, so I will make various diagrams for navigation and logic flow. Additionally, managing tasks means that we need to be forthright with how much work we can do on the project with all of our other classes and projects and with how much we understand. We've made a commitment to stay flexible and help each other as much as possible without putting anyone down. Testing is an important step, and we need to give ourselves plenty of time at the 'end' so that we can fix all of the bugs, make the code more logical and legible, and make the app more pleasant for the user. I plan to improve from other apps: I want to get started sooner, communicate with my group more often, and do all I can to help the group.
